Issues & Bugs:

I recommend we begin running a lot of our in game 'stuff' through the new
notifications manager. It can hold all objects that require calls when events
happen. It may be useful for attacking. Also, we should consider spawn pooling!

All button calls to game control go through the prefab (Could be an issue)

Need to solve an issue with syncing data over the game                              
control network. Thinking about doing away with MapManager
script and handling all map work through game control (data hub).

Game control also only supports a single file of save data right                        // PATCHED //
now. It wouldn't be hard to patch this! Then buttons could
be synced to game control.

Saving needs to be integrated into the game at some point. Possibly save
with a menu button or maybe save on scene changes. Animated icon needs 
to appear to show that you've saved successfully.

The save function currently creates a fresh file everytime you save.
There is no current merge and write back. Saving could be expensive
in the future.
